You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

These are gallery tests for image wrapped in `<figure>` elements.

To place a gallery add the necessary YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
gallery:
  - url: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-1.jpg
    image_path: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-1-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 1"
    title: "Image 1 title caption"
  - url: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-2.jpg
    image_path: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-2-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 2"
    title: "Image 2 title caption"
  - url: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg
    image_path: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-3-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 3"
    title: "Image 3 title caption"
  - url: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-4.jpg
    image_path: /assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-4-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 4"
    title: "Image 4 title caption"
```

And then drop-in the gallery include --- gallery `caption` is optional.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}

This is some text after the gallery just to make sure that everything aligns properly.

Here comes another gallery, this time set the `id` to match 2nd gallery hash in YAML Front Matter.

```yaml
gallery2:
  - url: https://flic.kr/p/8a6Ven
    image_path: https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1272/4697500467_8294dac099_q.jpg
    alt: "Black and grays with a hint of green"
  - url: https://flic.kr/p/8a738X
    image_path: https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4029/4697523701_249e93ba23_q.jpg
    alt: "Made for open text placement"
  - url: https://flic.kr/p/8a6VXP
    image_path: https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4046/4697502929_72c612c636_q.jpg
    alt: "Fog in the trees"
```

And place it like so: 

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="This is a second gallery example with images hosted externally." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="This is a second gallery example with images hosted externally." %}

And for giggles one more gallery just to make sure this works. To fill page content container add `class="full"`.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" class="full" caption="This is a third gallery example with two images and fills the entire content container." %}

Gallery column layout can be overrided by setting a `layout`.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery id="gallery" layout="half" caption="This is a half gallery layout example." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery id="gallery" layout="half" caption="This is a half gallery layout example." %}
